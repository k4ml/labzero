## Choosing FE Stack

This is really a hard question and failing to answer that question, we end up adding this specific section for Labzero. So the answer is ... it depends.

If your application is heavy on Reactive UI, we would recommend using VueJS. Otherwise we think [htmx] with the combination of [alpinejs] also good enough.

In Labzero we will provide examples for both libraries.
